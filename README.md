This are all of my university JAVA projects.
The followings are listed only for work examination purposes and no further use.

Here you'll find 3 main directories:

> Design Patterns :
	Most of these programs are made with design patterns and to exercise with all the tools I learned.

> Mak-Yek(with AI) :
	As the name already states, this is a version of the table game Mak-Yek in which you can play against an AI opponent written in ASP language.
	I used EMBASP, a University of Calabria's framework, to incorporate it in JAVA.

> Street Fighter :
	A simplified couch version of the traditional fighting game Street Fighter, of which I do not hold any property upon assets and music.
	I made it with a collegue for a school project and is not really an enjoyable game due to limitation of the tools we used, so keep this in mind.

You'll find further information about each project (if needed) in the respective readme file.
